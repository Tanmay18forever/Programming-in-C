# Programming-in-C
Here are some programs in C language:-

1. Write a program to print: “Hello World”.
2. Write a program to print sum of two numbers.
3. Write a program that prompts the user to enter their name and age and print the same.
4. Write a program to add two numbers, take number from user and print the sum.
5. Write a Program to print the address in multiple lines.
6. Write a Program to calculate the area and perimeter of a rectangle based on its length and width.
7. ⁠Write a program to Convert temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit using the formula: F = (C * 9/5) + 32.
8. Write a program to read a four digit integer and print the sum of its digits.
9. Write a program to demostrate the use of post(x++) and pre(++x) increment on a variable and also print the value.
10. Write a program to print the size of various data types in C.
11. Given three values write a program to read three values from keyboard and print out the largest of them.
12. Write a C program that takes an integer input and uses the bitwise AND (&) operator along with a ternary operator to check whether the number is even or odd.
13. Write a C program that takes an integer input from the user and checks whether the number is even or odd using an if-else statement.
14. Using nested if
Write a C program to take a person’s age as input and check if they are eligible to vote.
If the age is 18 or more, print "Eligible to vote".
If the age is less than 18, check again:
If the age is less than 0, print "Invalid age".
Otherwise, print "Not eligible to vote".
15. Using else-if ladder
Write a C program that asks the user to enter marks (0–100) and assigns a grade based on the following conditions:
90–100  Grade A
75–89  Grade B
50–74  Grade C
Below 50  Grade F
16. Write a C program that takes a number (1–7) as input and prints the corresponding day of the week using a switch case.
1  Monday
2 Tuesday, and so on
If the user enters a number outside 1–7, print "Invalid input".
17. Write a C program that takes two numbers and an operator (+, -, *, /) from the user and performs the operation using a switch case.
18. Write a program in C to calculate the sum of the first n natural numbers using a for loop
19. Write a C program using a loop to check if a number is prime or not.
20. Write a program to count how many digits a number has using a while loop.
21. Write a C program to find the factorial of a number using a while loop.
22. Write a C program for a simple calculator that repeatedly asks the user for two numbers and an operation (+, -, *, /) until the user chooses to exit. Must use a do while loop to repeat until exit.
23. Write a C program to find the maximum and minimum elements in an array using functions.
24. Write a C program to reverse the elements of an array using a function.
25. Write a C program to calculate the average of n numbers stored in an array using a function.
26. Write a C program to count how many even and odd numbers are present in an array using functions.
